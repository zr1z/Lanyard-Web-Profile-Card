# Lanyard-Web-Profile-Card
A website profile card built with React, Vite, and TypeScript.

Setup Guide:

- Download the files
- Open the file `UseLanyardData.ts` and change `const fetchId` to your discordId
- Open a new terminal, run the command `npm i` or `npm install` to install all dependencies.

What this uses:

[Lanyard](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard) For status, avatar and activity presence
[DCDN](https://gist.github.com/dustinrouillard/04be36180ed80db144a4857408478854) For bio fetching

This was a project that was never finished, by any means this code can be used and expanded by who ever may want it.
